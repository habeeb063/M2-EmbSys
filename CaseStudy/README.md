# Case Study #

## Washing Machine ##

 ## Introduction ##

 * A washing machine is a machine that washes dirty clothes.

 * The fallowing case study is used to analyze the working of washing machine, its architecture.

 ## Design of Washing Machine

 
  ## Washing machine Controller


 * It is the main controller which controllers all the units.

 * It interacts with all section in order to complete the washing cycle.


 ## Valve Control Unit

 * This unit control the water inlet valve and drain valve.

 * All the operations are done by the power switches like Triac’s, Logic-Level gate.


 ## Sensor Unit

 * Sensor unit contains all the information of the sensors which are used in washing machine.

 * Different sensor for load check (clothes weight).

 * Similarly, it contains information for all other sensors required in washing machine.

 *  Some examples of sensors are water availability check, detergent availability, door open/close, balance check and trap check.

 ## Motor Control Unit

 *  This unit controls the functioning of motor.

 * It contains all the information about the rotation of motor,such as when motor rotates in clockwise direction and when in counter clockwise.

 * It also contains the information when motor will on  and off in all three cases i.e., washing, rinsing and drying.

 ## Display Unit ##

 * The display unit consist of LEDs to indicate the completion of process, occurrence of some problem while washing, set or reset of buttons, etc. 
 * Seven segment display for the numeric value display and also for the message display of errors.


 ## Requirements:## 

  ## High level:
     
  * The user can be able to wash his/her cloth in washing machine based on cloth material.
 * 	The washing machine automatically dry’s the cloth.
 * 	The machine has different user-friendly options.
 *	The machine displays the time require to wash.
 *	It has multi-functional buttons for user.
 *	It has Built in surge protector.
 * 	It has child protection.
 *	It has door sensor for the protection.
 *	The machine comes with different range of price according to the user demand.
 *	The user can also add conditioners for pleasant smell.

  ## Low Level: ## 

 *	It has a different options like Delicate, Sports, Wool, Cotton Synthetic etc.
 *	It has option like mixed cloth, Quick 15 mins wash.
 *	User can also increase the temperature of water to 20 °C, 40 °C, 60 °C. 
 *	It has built-in display to show different option like motor speed, temperature and different mode.
 *	The different buttons are on/Off, Speed, Temperature, Start/Pause.
 *	It has ESD (Electrostatic Discharge) protection to protect machine from surge.
 *	Child protection can be activated by long press of Speed button.
 *	Magnet sensor or Reed sensors are used for door protection.
 *	The different range of machine is based on drum capacity i.e., 6kg to 18kg.
 *	It has a special cabinet for the detergent and conditioners.
