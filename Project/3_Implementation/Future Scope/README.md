## Future scope

* In future the whole project can be implemented by Arduino Uno board and ESP8266 microchip.
* The whole module is based on IoT and uses Blink Application, Adafruit website.
* The ESP8266 module is used to transmit the data to IoT website i.e, io.Adafruit and control the appliances via Blink app.
* The Adafruit is open source cloud service platform and user can visualize the data by graphical representation.
* The IFTTT (If This Then That) is used to send mail when threshold value is reached.
* The Blink app is configured to control the appliances froma anywhere.
* The current sensor is attached to arduino to get the current value.
* The Vrms and Irms is calculated based on current to compute for power.
* Based on the energy consumption the bill amount is compute and sent to adafruit.
* If the bill amount is reached threshold the auto generated mail is recevied by the user.
* Based on that the uses can monitor, analyze and control the appliances.
